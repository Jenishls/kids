                <p class="f-17">Austin Co-Owner Lauren Doering has moved eight times in her life, and every time has been within the Austin Metro Area. She and her partners decided to launch Crates on Skates in the growing city of Austin, TX. They bring environmentally friendly moving crates to the central Texas market. Crates on Skates are a more convenient, cost effective and stronger alternative to cardboard. Moving companies really like them too.
